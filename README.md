# NeuroDecode
"NeuroDecode" bridges the gap between external stimuli and the brain's corresponding neural signals. By decoding these neural responses, I hope to unravel the mysteries of how the brain perceives and processes different stimuli, thus gaining deeper insights into brain functionalities and potential applications in medical and technological domains.
